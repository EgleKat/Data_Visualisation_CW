  <h1>Are EU Immigrants Harming the People of the UK?</h1>
  There has been an increase in negative opinions about immigrants from European Union.
 <br> 'EU immigrants are just criminals that claim our benefits', 'I want the NHS to be funded properly without EU immigrants wasting all of the budget', 'I voted leave. Why? Because immigrants have nothing to give to this country' - are just a few I heard personally. Do these opinions have any grounds? Let's take a look at crime, work and nhs expenditure to find out.
  <div id="prison_charts">
    <br>
    First, let's look at prison statistics. Here is how many people are in UK prisons. Purple colour is nationals and yellow is foreigners. 
    <br>
    Out of all foreigners EEA citizens are the majority, which isn't great. Now compare it with citizens of the UK - the number doesn't seem that big now, does it?
    <div class="chart" styles="width:800px  !important">

    </svg></div>

      <br><br>
      But that's just the number of people in prisons, how does it compare to the total number in the whole UK?
      Take a look at the chart below.
    <div class="chart">
    
      <br><br>  
      Try pressing on the bars from the last chart and this one to investigate further. If the colour glitches out, try restarting the page.

      <h3>Percentage of People in Prisons Compared to Nationalities' Population in the UK (2018)</h3>
      <div id="prison_bar_chart"></div>

    </div>
<br> <br>
      So, out of all of EU citizens living in the UK, the percentage in prisons is actually the lowest out of all other regions in the world, including of the UK!
      <br><br>
      What about region? Let's take a look.<br>
      <br>
      Here is criminal activity displayed on a map. The stronger the red, the more criminal activity was noted in that region.
      The bigger the bubble, the more percentage of EU citizens live in that area.

<br> <br>
London seems to have a lot of criminal activity and there's a bigger percentage of EU citizens living here compared to UK citizens than anywhere else. A-ha, there's a connection!
<br>
<b>But wait</b>, look at North West, the criminal activity there is also high. What percentage of EU citizens live there? Hover over the data point.
<br>
The ratio is 0.04, which means that in that area only 4% of people are from the European Union compared to UK citizens, which is lower than East of England, where crime isn't that prominent.
<br><br> 
What can we say about that data? Perhaps criminal activity isn't impacted by nationality but maybe the size of metropolitan areas in the region?


<br> <br><br><br>
Now...are EU immigrants just claiming benefits and not contributing to the country at all?
Look at the next chart.
<br>
Compare how many people are working in the UK and paying taxes and how many are unemployed?
Economically inactive people are students, elderly etc.
<br><br>
EU citizens are actually working <b>more</b> than UK nationals and even more than people from other countries.

Now let's look at how much of NHS funds are being used up by foreigners. Keep in mind that some of that money (from visitors) could be retrieved with extensive amount of documentation.
<br><br>
Wow! Over 300 million. That is quite a lot.
<br>
How does it compare to the overall budget? Press that button below.
<br><br>
The other bars barely show up on the graph now. Does 300 million seem like a big sum now?

If you would like to know more about how much EU citizens contribute to the NHS, read this

<br><br><br><br>
If you used just these graphs, would you say that EU immigrants seem like scary criminals, unhelpful, selfish users or do they contribute more than they take? I only want to encourage everyone to make their opinions based on legitimate proof and data to not end up like the person in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-boris-johnson-nhs-bus-claim-350-million-fundraiser-campaign-prosecute-a8528886.html">this article</a>.
<br>
If you are unsure about this data or the graphs I have shown, I strongly encourage you to find datasets that will let you make an informed opinion about this (or any) subject.
